# Note: The entire contents of flatpak-basic.yml is repeated here because
# you can really only run this module once per build.  An appparent fix for this
# (see https://github.com/blue-build/modules/pull/263) doesn't do what we need --
# the fix only makes sure the effects of the 1st module run are not overwritten
# (any subsequent runs are ignored).

modules:
  - type: default-flatpaks
    notify: true # Send notification after install/uninstall is finished (true/false)
    system:
      # If no repo information is specified, Flathub will be used by default
      # repo-url: https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
      # repo-name: flathub
      # repo-title: "Flathub (system-wide)" # Optional; this sets the remote's user-facing name in graphical frontends like GNOME Software
